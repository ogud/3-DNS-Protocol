       Third Party DNS operator to Registrars/Registries Protocol
          draft-ietf-regext-dnsoperator-to-rrr-protocol-01.txt

Abstract

   There are several problems that arise in the standard
   Registrant/Registrar/Registry model when the operator of a zone is
   neither the Registrant nor the Registrar for the delegation.
   Historically the issues have been minor, and limited to difficulty
   guiding the Registrant through the initial changes to the NS records
   for the delegation.  As this is usually a one time activity when the
   operator first takes charge of the zone it has not been treated as a
   serious issue.

   When the domain on the other hand uses DNSSEC it necessary to make
   regular (sometimes annual) changes to the delegation, in order to
   track KSK rollover, by updating the delegation's DS record(s).  Under
   the current model this is prone to delays and errors.  Even when the
   Registrant has outsourced the operation of DNS to a third party the
   registrant still has to be in the loop to update the DS record.

   There is a need for a simple protocol that allows a third party DNS
   operator to update DS and NS records in a trusted manner for a
   delegation without involving the registrant for each operation.  This
   same protocol can be used by Registrants.

   The protocol described in this draft is REST based, and when used
   through an authenticated channel can be used to establish the DNSSEC
   Initial Trust (to turn on DNSSEC or bootstrap DNSSEC).  Once DNSSEC
   trust is established this channel can be used to trigger maintenance
   of delegation records such as DS, NS, and glue records.  The protocol
   is kept as simple as possible.

1.  Introduction

   Why is this needed?  DNS registration systems today are designed
   around making registrations easy and fast.  After the domain has been
   registered there are really three options on who maintains the DNS
   zone that is loaded on the "primary" DNS servers for the domain this
   can be the Registrant, Registrar, or a third party DNS Operator.

   Unfortunately the ease to make changes differs for each one of these
   options.  The Registrant needs to use the interface that the
   registrar provides to update NS and DS records.  The Registrar on the
   other hand can make changes directly into the registration system.
   The third party DNS Operator on the hand needs to go through the
   Registrant to update any delegation information.

   Current system does not work well, there are many types of failures
   have been reported and they have been at all levels in the
   registration model.

   The failures result either inability to use DNSSEC or in validation
   failures that cause the domain to become invalid and all users that
   are behind validating resolvers will not be able to to access the
   domain.

   The goal of this document is to create an automated interface that
   will reduce the friction in maintaining DNSSEC delegations.

2.  Notional Conventions

2.1.  Definitions

   For the purposes of this draft, a third-party DNS Operator is any DNS
   Operator responsible for a zone where the operator is neither the
   Registrant nor the Registrar of record for the delegation.

   Uses of the word 'Registrar' in this document may also be applied to
   resellers: an entity that sells delegations through a registrar with
   whom the entity has a reseller agreement.

2.2.  RFC2119 Keywords

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  What is the goal?

   The primary goal is to have a protocol to establish a secure chain of
   trust that involves parties that are not in the traditional
   Registrant/Registrar/Registry (RRR) model.

   A DNS operator cannot easily and scalably identify the registrar (or
   registration agent, or reseller) for a domain name it is operating.
   Thus the DNS operator has to fallback to relying on the registrant
   (as customer) of the services to establish a secure chain of trust.

   In the general case there should be a way to find the right
   Registrar/Registry entity to talk to, but it does not exist.  Whois[]
   is the natural protocol to carry such information but that protocol
   but is unreliable and hard to parse.  Its proposed successor RDAP
   [RFC7480] has yet be deployed on most TLD's.

   The preferred communication mechanism is to use is to use a REST
   [RFC6690] call to start processing of the requested delegation
   information.

3.1.  How does a child signal its parent it wants to establish a secure
      chain of trust?

   The child needs first to sign the domain, then the child can "upload"
   the DS record to its parent.  The "normal" way to upload a DS record
   is for the registrant to go through registration interface and submit



Latour, et al.            Expires July 8, 2017                  [Page 4]

Internet-Draft                  3-DNS-RRR                   January 2017


   a DS record (or DNSKEY or both), but a lack of registrar/reseller
   DNSSEC support in sufficient frequency is a significant operational
   problem to the detriment of DNSSEC adoption.

   The DNS Operator may not have access to the interface thus the
   registrant needs to relay the information.  For large operations this
   does not scale, as evident in lack of Trust Anchors for signed
   deployments that are operated by third parties.

   The child can signal its desire to have DNSSEC validation enabled by
   publishing one of the special DNS records CDS and/or CDNSKEY[RFC7344]
   and its proposed extension [I-D.ietf-dnsop-maintain-ds].

   Once the "parent" "sees" these records it SHOULD start acceptance
   processing.  This document covers how to make the CDS records visible
   to the right parental agent.

   This document and [I-D.ogud-dnsop-maintain-ds] argue that the
   publication of CDS/CDNSKEY record is sufficient for the parent to
   start the acceptance processing.  The main point is to provide
   authentication thus if the child is in "good" state then the DS
   upload should be simple to accept and publish.  If there is any
   problem the parent does not add the DS.

   In the event this protocols and its associated authentication
   mechanism does not address the Registrant's security requirements to
   create a secure delegation then the Registrant always has recourse by
   submitting its DS record via its registration interface.

3.2.  How does a parental agent detects maintenance activities

   One the secure chain of trust is established, the parent should
   implement a system to automate domain polling for CDS maintenance
   record changes.  The maintenance activities includes adding or
   removing DS record(s) [I-D.ogud-dnsop-maintain-ds].

   Each parental agent is responsible to develop and implement and
   communicate their DNSSEC maintenance policies.

3.3.  What checks are needed by parent?

   The parent upon receiving a signal or detecting through polling that
   the child desires to have its DS record published.  The basic tests
   include,







Latour, et al.            Expires July 8, 2017                  [Page 5]

   1. Is the zone is properly signed as per the parent DNSSEC policy
   2. The zone has a CDS signed by a KSK referenced in the current CDS,
      referring to a at least one key in the current DNSKEY RRset
   3. All the name-servers for the zone agree on the CDS RRset contents

   NOTE:(do we need a new section in the DPS for the CDS management
   policy [RFC6841]?)

   Parents can perform additional tests, defined delays, queries over
   TCP, ensure zone delegation best practice as per
   [I-D.wallstrom-dnsop-dns-delegation-requirements] and even ask the
   DNS Operator to prove they can add data to the zone, or provide a
   code that is tied to the affected zone.  The protocol is partially-
   synchronous, i.e. the server can elect to hold connection open until
   the operation has concluded or it can return that it received the
   request.  It is up to the child to monitor the parent for completion
   of the operation and issue possible follow-up calls.

   The parent can have a policy to accept a CDS signed by a ZSK or a
   CSK.  The parent should not make any changes to DS RRset if the child
   name-servers do not agree on content.

4.  Third Party DNS operator to Registrars/Registries RESTful API

   The specification of this API is minimalist, but a realistic one.

   This API may be denied access to change the DS records for domains
   that are Registry Locked (HTTP Status code 401).  Registry Lock is a
   mechanisms provided by certain registries or registrars that prevents
   domain hijacking by ensuring no attributes of the domain are
   changeable and no transfer or deletion transactions can be processed
   against the domain name may prevents certain attributes in the
   registry to be changed (locks).

4.1.  API Authentication

   The API does not impose any unique server authentication
   requirements.  The server authentication provided by TLS fully
   addresses the needs.  The API MUST be provided over TLS-protected
   transport (e.g., HTTPS) or VPN.

4.2.  API Authorization

   Authorization to access the API is outside the scope of this
   document.  The publication of CDS record(s) in the child zone file
   are indications of intention to perform DS records activities (add/
   delete) for the domain in the parent zone.  This means the proceeding
   of the API action is not determined by who issued the API request but



Latour, et al.            Expires July 8, 2017                  [Page 6]

Internet-Draft                  3-DNS-RRR                   January 2017


   by the intention in the CDS publication.  Therefore, authorization is
   out of scope.  Registries and registrars who plan to provide this
   service can, however, implement their own policy to protect access to
   the API such as IP white listing, API key, etc.

4.3.  API Base URL Locator

   The base URL for registries or registrars who want to provide this
   service to DNS Operators can be made auto-discoverable as an RDAP
   extension.

4.4.  CDS resource

   Path: /domains/{domain}/cds {domain}: is the domain name to be
   operated on

4.4.1.  Initial Trust Establishment (Enable DNSSEC validation)

4.4.1.1.  Request

   Syntax: POST /domains/{domain}/cds

   A DS record based on the CDS record in the child zone file will be
   inserted into the registry and the parent zone file upon the
   successful completion of such request.  If there are multiple CDS
   records in the CDS RRset, multiple DS records will be added.

4.4.1.2.  Response

   o  HTTP Status code 201 indicates a success.

   o  HTTP Status code 400 indicates a failure due to validation.

   o  HTTP Status code 401 indicates an unauthorized resource access.

   o  HTTP Status code 403 indicates a failure due to an invalid
      challenge token.

   o  HTTP Status code 404 indicates the domain does not exist.

   o  HTTP Status code 500 indicates a failure due to unforeseeable
      reasons.

4.4.2.  Removing a DS (turn off DNSSEC)

Internet-Draft                  3-DNS-RRR                   January 2017


4.4.2.1.  Request

                   Syntax: DELETE /domains/{domain}/cds

   A null CDS or CDNSKEY record mean the entire DS RRset must be
   removed.

4.4.2.2.  Response

   o  HTTP Status code 200 indicates a success.

   o  HTTP Status code 400 indicates a failure due to validation.

   o  HTTP Status code 401 indicates an unauthorized resource access.

   o  HTTP Status code 404 indicates the domain does not exist.

   o  HTTP Status code 500 indicates a failure due to unforeseeable
      reasons.

4.4.3.  DS Maintenance

4.4.3.1.  Request

                     Syntax: PUT /domains/{domain}/cds

   Maintenance activities are performed based on the CDS available in
   the child zone.  DS records may be added, removed.  But the entire DS
   RRset must not be deleted.

4.4.3.2.  Response

   o  HTTP Status code 200 indicates a success.

   o  HTTP Status code 400 indicates a failure due to validation.

   o  HTTP Status code 401 indicates an unauthorized resource access.

   o  HTTP Status code 404 indicates the domain does not exist.

   o  HTTP Status code 500 indicates a failure due to unforeseeable
      reasons.

4.5.  Tokens resource

   Path: /domains/{domain}/tokens {domain}: is the domain name to be
   operated on

4.5.1.  Setup Initial Trust Establishment with Challenge

4.5.1.1.  Request

                   Syntax: POST /domains/{domain}/tokens

   The parent's DNSSEC policy may require proof the DNS Operator is in
   control of the domain.
   The token API call returns a random token to be included as a
   _delegate TXT record prior establishing the DNSSEC initial trust.
   This is an additional trust control mechanism to establish the
   initial chain of trust.  Note that the _delegate TXT record is
   publicly available and not a secret token.

4.5.1.2.  Response

   o  HTTP Status code 200 indicates a success.  Token included in the
      body of the response, as a valid TXT record

   o  HTTP Status code 404 indicates the domain does not exist.

   o  HTTP Status code 500 indicates a failure due to unforeseeable
      reasons.

4.6.  Customized Error Messages

   Service providers can provide a customized error message in the
   response body in addition to the HTTP status code defined in the
   previous section.

   This can include an Identifying number/string that can be used to
   track the requests.

   #Using the definitions This section at the moment contains comments
   from early implementers

4.7.  How to react to 403 on POST cds

   The basic reaction to a 403 on POST /domains/{domain}/cds is to issue
   POST /domains/{domain}/tokens command to fetch the challenge to
   insert into the zone.

5.  Security considerations

   When domains are provisioned with good Internet hygiene and zone
   delegation follows best practice such as
   [I-D.wallstrom-dnsop-dns-delegation-requirements], the registrar or




Latour, et al.            Expires July 8, 2017                  [Page 9]

   registry can then trust the DNS information it queried over two
   different ASN and over TCP to establish the initial chain of trust.

   In addition, the registrar or registry can required the DNS Operator
   to prove they control the zone by adding a challenge token a to the
   zone.

   This protocol should increase the adoption of DNSSEC and get more
   zones to become validated thus overall the security gain outweighs
   the possible drawbacks.

   Registrant and DNS Operator always have the option to establish the
   chain of trust in band via the standard Registrant/Registrar/Registry
   model.
