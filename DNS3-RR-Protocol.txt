       Third Party DNS operator to Registrars/Registries Protocol
               draft-ogud-dnsoperator-to-RRR-protocol-00

Abstract

   There are several problems that arise in the standard
   Registrant/Registrar/Registry model when the operator of a zone is
   neither the Registrant nor the Registrar for the delegation.
   Historically the issues have been minor, and limited to difficulty
   guiding the Registrant through the initial changes to the NS records
   for the delegation.  As this is usually a one time activity when the
   operator first takes charge of the zone it has not been treated as a
   serious issue.

   When the domain on the other hand uses DNSSEC it necessary for the
   Registrant in this situation to make regular (sometimes annual)
   changes to the delegation in order to track KSK rollover, by updating
   the delegation's DS record(s).  Under the current model this is prone
   to Registrant error and significant delays.  Even when the Registrant
   has outsourced the operation of DNS to a third party the registrant
   still has to be in the loop to update the DS record.

   There is a need for a simple protocol that allows a third party DNS
   operator to update DS and NS records for a delegation without
   involving the registrant for each operation.

   The protocol described in this draft is REST based, and when used
   through an authenticated channel can be used to bootstrap DNSSEC.
   Once DNSSEC is established this channel can be used to trigger
   maintenance of delegation records such as DS, NS, and glue records.
   The protocol is kept as simple as possible.

1.  Introduction

   Why is this needed ? DNS registration systems today are designed
   around making registrations easy and fast.  After the domain has been
   registered the there are really three options on who maintains the
   DNS zone that is loaded on the "primary" DNS servers for the domain
   this can be the Registrant, Registar, or a third party.

   Unfortunatley the ease to make changes differes for each one of these
   options.  The Registrant needs to use the interface that the registar
   provides to update NS and DS records.  The Registrar on the other
   hand can make changes directly into the registration system.  The
   third party operator on the hand needs to go through the Registrant
   to update any delegation information.

   Current system does not work well, there are many examples of
   failures including the inabilty to upload DS records du to non-
   support by Registar interface, the registrant forgets/does-not
   perform action but tools proceed with key rollover without checking
   that the new DS is in place.  Another common failure is the DS record
   is not removed when the DNS operator changes from one that supports
   DNSSEC signing to one that does not.

   The failures result either inabilty to use DNSSEC or in validation
   failures that case the domain to become invalid and all users that
   are behind validating resolvers will not be able to to access the
   domain.

2.  Notational Conventions

2.1.  Definitions

   For the purposes of this draft, a third-party DNS operator is any DNS
   operator responsible for a zone where the operator is neither the
   Registrant nor the Registrar of record for the delegation.

   When we say Registrar that can in many cases be applied to a Reseller
   i.e. an entity that sells delegations but registrations are processed
   through the Registrar.

2.2.  RFC2119 Keywords

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  What is the goal ?

   The primary goal is to use the DNS protocol to provide information
   from child zone to the parent zone, this is a way to maintain the
   delegation information.  The precondition for this to be practical is
   that the domain is DNSSEC signed.

   IN the general case there should be a way to find the right
   Registrar/Registry entity to talk to but that does not exist.
   Whois[] is the natural protocol to carry such information but that
   protcol is unreliable and hard to parse.  Its proposed successor RDAP
   [RFC7480] has yet be deployed on any TLD.

   The preferred communication mechanism is to use is to use a REST
   [RFC6690] call to start processing of the requested delegation
   information.

3.1.  Why DNSSEC ?

   DNSSEC [RFC4035] provides data authentication for DNS answers, having
   DNSSEC enabled makes it possible to trust the answers.  The biggest
   stumbling block is deploying DNSSEC is the intial configuration of
   the DNSSEC domain trust anchor in the parent, DS record.

3.2.  How does Domain signal to parent it wants DNSSEC Trust Anchor ?

   The child needs first to sign the domain, then the child can "upload"
   the DS record.  The "normal" way to upload is to go through
   registration interface, but that fails frequently.  The DNS operator
   may not have access to the interface thus the registrant needs to
   relay the information.  For large operations this does not scale, as
   evident in lack of Trust Anchors for signed deploymentns that are
   operated by third parties.

   The child can signal its desire to have DNSSEC validation enabled by
   publishing one of the special DNS records CDS and/or
   CDNSKEY[RFC7344].  Once the "parent" "sees" these records it SHOULD
   start acceptance processing.  This document will cover below how to
   make the CDS records visilbe to the right parental agent.

   We argued that the publication of CDS/CDNSKEY record is sufficent for
   the parent to start acceptance processing, the main point is to
   provide authentication thus if the child is in "good" state and the
   DS upload should be simple to accept and publish.  If at any time the
   parent has abilty to remove the DS if it discovers that the DS was
   upploaded in error.

3.3.  What checks are needed by parent ?

   The parent uppon receiving a signal that it check the child for
   desire for DS record publication.  The basic tests include,

       #. All the nameservers for the zone agree on zone contents
       #. The zone is signed
       #. The zone has a CDS signed by the KSK referenced i the CDS

   Parents can have additional tests, defined delays, and even ask the
   DNS operator to prove they can add data to the zone, or provide a
   code that is tied to the affected zone.

4.  OP-3-DNS-RR Protocol

4.1.  Command

   The basic call is

                          <SERVER>Update/<domain>/

   The following options to the commands are specified

   "auth=" an authenticaion token

   "debug=" request a debug session

4.2.  Answers

   The basic answer is a jason blob the these are some possible blocks
   in the response:

   "refer:" will contain an URI; this is an referal to an URI that is
   better able to do execute the command

   "refused:" This command can not be executed, and the reason is inside
   the block

   "debug:" list of debug messages normally empty unless debug flag is
   present, this section should be ignored in normal processing

   "error:" if there was one look inside debug for more details

   "domain:" what domain this is an answer for this section MUST be
   included in all answers

   "rr:" the new list of rrs "can be empty"

Internet-Draft                  3-DNS-RRR                   October 2015


   "id:" An identifier for the transaction

   If ``refer'' block is present in answer then the client is instructed
   to connect to that URI and retry the command there.  Client SHOULD
   always honor the refer command over all other answers it gets in the
   answer.

5.  Authorization

   The authorization can be either based on Token (like auth code) or
   buy challenge i.e. inserting a blob into the zone.  It is up to
   registrars to register the referral URI with registries, or block the
   access to updating DS and NS.

   OAUTH??? would work how ???

6.  Security considerations

   TBD This will hopefully get more zones to become validated thus
   overall the security gain outweights the possible drawbacks.

7.  IANA Actions

   URI ??? TBD

8.  Internationalization Considerations

   This protcol is designed for machine to machine communications
